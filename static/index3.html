        <p>Buy yourself a pizza stone because oh golly that thing is a wonder of a tool. All you need to do is prep some dough, throw the stone into an oven preheated to 500 degrees and you're ready to rock! It's so tasty and worth it. Go to your local trader joes and pick up some dough if you don't want to put in the effort. Make sure to get fresh Mozzarella for Italian pizzas and Low-Moisture Mozzarella for New York style pizzas. Fresh Mozzarella should be used lightly as it gives it's moisture into the dough. Using too much could result in a soggy pizza. Not wanted</p>
